Shakespearean-Monkeys
=====================
About:

Java GUI application modelled from the famous Infinite Monkey Theorem (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem)
Multi-threaded application that demonstrates a theoretical genetic monkey evolution described by Daniel Shiffman at 
http://shiffman.net/projects/shakespearemonkeyhome/. 

Features:

  -Select number of monkeys in each generation (even number between 2-10000)
  
  -Change the target text for the monkeys to type (initially Hamlet's soliloquy)
  
  -Start/Cancel the evolution process, when evolution is complete timer will stop
  
  -Timer displays speed of evolution, time elapsed and number of generations so far
  
  -Can choose a sequential or parallel (utilizes multiple cores) evolution, hence faster evolutions for larger population sizes.
